# git-att

Check if the current git project needs attention by checking the following:

- Is the repo on the master branch?
- Is the current branch ahead of the remote tracking branch?
- Is the repo dirty (i.e. does it contain changes that have not yet been
  checked in)
- Is there any untracked files in the repo?

If the answer is yes to any of those questions, this module will let you
know.
